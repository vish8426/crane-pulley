Crane &amp; Pulley System - Mechanical Engineering System

## About
The project at hand involves designing a machine that is able to move either sandstone block to any position (and be swapped in order) along a concrete ramp on a sculptural art piece. The sculptural composition sits on a grass and dirt terrain surrounded further by concrete walkways on all four sides.
