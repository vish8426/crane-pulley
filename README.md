Crane &amp; Pulley System - Mechanical Engineering System

## About
The project at hand involves designing a machine that is able to move either sandstone block to any position (and be swapped in order) along a concrete ramp on a sculptural art piece. The sculptural composition sits on a grass and dirt terrain surrounded further by concrete walkways on all four sides.

## Overview

The Crane & Pulley System is a mechanical engineering solution designed to facilitate the movement and positioning of sandstone blocks on a sculptural installation. The system ensures precise placement and the ability to swap blocks in order.

## Project Objectives

- Design a mechanical system to move sandstone blocks along a concrete ramp.
- Ensure the system can swap blocks in order for dynamic arrangement.
- Integrate the system seamlessly within the existing terrain and walkways.
- Maintain structural integrity and safety throughout operation.

## Design Considerations

- **Terrain Integration**: The system is designed to operate on a grass and dirt terrain, necessitating stability and adaptability.
- **Load Management**: The crane and pulley mechanism is engineered to handle the weight and dimensions of sandstone blocks.
- **Aesthetic Compatibility**: The design complements the sculptural art piece, ensuring that the mechanical components do not detract from the visual appeal.
- **Safety Measures**: Incorporation of safety features to prevent accidents during operation.

## Applications

- **Art Installations**: Facilitates dynamic arrangements in sculptural art pieces.
- **Educational Demonstrations**: Serves as a practical example of mechanical engineering principles.
- **Construction Projects**: Adaptable for small-scale material handling tasks.
